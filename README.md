# Animating an Inflatable Tube Man

In researching this idea, we noticed that the inflatable tube man posed an interesting challenge in combining particle physics and material modelling. We have yet to find anything that contributes to such a field, and we’d like to test the interplay between the two in our project.

## Challenges
1. First, we must define the particle physics for wind dynamics, which we haven’t yet learned in the context of graphics.
2. Second, we must define the tube man’s body, which requires deformation physics, as well as self-collision physics.
3. Third, we must define the interaction between particles and our tube man body, to be able to simulate the tube man’s characteristic motion.
